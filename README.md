# msa-readme-parser

Simple webpage to display a README.md file (written in markdown) with the MSA colors.

Once the page loads, it will try to fetch /README.md, parse & display the markdown. The markdown conversion to HTML is done in the browser, thanks to the [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) library.
